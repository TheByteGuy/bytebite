## Background
Hey! We are ByteBite, a team of four dedicated to developing an interactive website that helps RPI students build healthier and more optimal food plans. With the stress of midterms, finals, and college life in general, students often don’t have the time to figure out what they should be eating to stay healthy.

Our website solves this by offering:

- AI-powered meal recommendations tailored to dietary restrictions

- Text-to-speech accessibility for inclusive use

- A highly customizable user interface to match individual preferences

ByteBite makes healthy eating simple, fast, and personalized.
